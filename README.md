# email-service-api
**REST**ful Email service API that integrates with multiple email service providers to send emails.

As you need to setup a domain and DNS records usually to send to any email address, I have not gone down this path, but have created a test email address to which this email service can send emails to.

The credentials to the email address are 
```
u/n: emailsvc2019@gmail.com
p/w: Test1234%
```

The API is running on heroku and can be reached at this address
